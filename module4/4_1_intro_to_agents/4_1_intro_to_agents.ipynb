    "\n",
    "This lesson introduced the powerful concept of **Agents** in LangChain, where an **LLM** acts as the brain to **make decisions** and **perform actions** through **Tools**. We clearly distinguished between **Chains** (fixed flow) and **Agents** (dynamic planning capability and tool use). You also understood the **structure of an Agent** including the LLM, Tools, and Agent Executor, along with how an Agent performs the **Reasoning** and **Acting** process in a continuous loop to achieve its goal. Mastering Agents is key to building truly intelligent LLM applications capable of automation and real-world problem-solving."
