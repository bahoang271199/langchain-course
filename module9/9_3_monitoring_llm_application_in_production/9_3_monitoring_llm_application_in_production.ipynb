    "* **Error Rate:**\n",
    "    * **Definition:** The proportion of requests that result in an error (e.g., API errors, parsing errors, Agent logic errors).\n",
    "    * **Why Important:** A high error rate indicates system instability.\n",
    "    * **Points to Track:** Overall error rate, error rate by type (e.g., LLM errors, Tool errors, network errors).\n",
    "* **Token Cost:**\n",
    "    * **Definition:** The number of input and output tokens used by the LLM, directly impacting API costs.\n",
    "    * **Why Important:** Helps control budget and optimize LLM usage.\n",
    "    * **Points to Track:** Total tokens used, average tokens per request, estimated cost.\n",
    "* **Output Quality - via User Feedback:**\n",
    "    * **Definition:** The degree of user satisfaction with the LLM's response.\n",
    "    * **Why Important:** The ultimate assessment of the application's usefulness and effectiveness.\n",

    "        * **User Surveys:** Collect more detailed qualitative feedback.\n",
    "* **Other Metrics:**\n",
    "    * **Tool Usage Rate:** Frequency with which specific tools are called.\n",
    "    * **Hallucination Rate:** The proportion of responses containing factually incorrect information (difficult to measure automatically, often requires manual evaluation or LLM-as-a-Judge).\n",
    "    * **Refusal Rate:** The proportion of times the Agent refuses to answer a question.\n",
